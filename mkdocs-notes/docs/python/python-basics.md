## Introduction

___

- Computers are not very intelligent. Humans make them intelligent by telling what to do and how to do it.
- We, humans, communicate in verbal or non-verbal ways with other humans and using a human language e.g. English.
- But we cannot communicate with computers in same way. 
- Computers understand programming languages e.g. Python.
- Computers follow instructions written in programming languages.
- We will learn how to write instructions in python programming language.


## Python

---

- Python execute instructions line by line.
- Python instructions are codes that we write in it.


### Comments

---

- comments are not executed in python

- single line comment
    - add # in front of line to make it a single-line comment. 

```python
# this code is to add 2 numbers
# you need to give values of a and b
a = 10 
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
```

- multiple lines comment 
    - add 3 single or double quotes in beginning and end of comment to make a multi-line comment.

```python
'''this code is to add 2 numbers
you need to give values of a and b.'''

"""this code is to add 2 numbers
you need to give values of a and b."""
a = 10 
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
```


### Variables

---

- variables store data
- variables have names.
- variables names can have alphabets, numbers and underscores. But it cannot start with number.
- you cannot use some python keywords as variables names - such as if, else, int, float, etc.
